# Stock Price Tracker and News Report Generator



This system consists of two main components:
1. **Stock Price Tracker**: A Python script that tracks the price of a stock in real-time and sends desktop notifications when significant price changes occur.
2. **Streamlit News Report Generator**: A Streamlit-based web application that searches for recent news about a stock and generates a detailed report using AI.
